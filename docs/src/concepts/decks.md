# Decks

A deck is a collection of cards that a player uses to play the game. Before a game begins, each player must have a pre-built deck.

## Deckbuilding

While the game engine does not yet enforce strict deckbuilding rules, here are the general principles and intended guidelines for constructing a deck:

- **Deck Size**: A deck should typically consist of a fixed number of cards (between 30 and 60).
- **Card Copies**: Players are usually limited to a maximum number of copies of any single card (e.g., no more than 4 copies of a card with the same name).
- **Domains**: A player can choose to build a deck with cards from a single `domain` (e.g., a "mono-Volcano" deck) or combine cards from multiple domains. Building a deck with multiple domains gives you more flexibility, but it can be harder to consistently draw the right resources to play your cards.

A well-constructed deck has a good "mana curve" - a balanced mix of low-cost cards that can be played in the early game and high-cost, powerful cards for the late game. It should also have a clear strategy, whether that's overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creatures, controlling the board with spells, or assembling a powerful combination of cards.
